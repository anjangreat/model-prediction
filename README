The model has been run on 5 prediction model with results based on MSE and R^2.
The values taken are in ratio 70:30(70 for training  and 30 testing).
The final results are stored in model_results.csv
FLOW IS AS FOLLOWS-
1. Import Libraries

pandas for data manipulation.

scikit-learn for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. Load Dataset

The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. Ensure the CSV file is in the correct directory, or update the file path in the code.

3. Data Preparation

Feature Selection: The features (F1 to F15) are selected as predictors.

Target Selection: Target1 is used as the response variable.

Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into 70% training and 30% testing data.

Standardization: The features are standardized for consistent scaling using StandardScaler.

4. Model Training

The following models are trained:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

5. Model Evaluation

Each model is evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures average squared errors.

R² Score: Indicates how well the model explains variance in the target variable.

6. Save Results

Model results (MSE and R²) are saved to a CSV file (model_results.csv) for reference.
